# Numerical Methods

This is a collection of Julia modules with algorithms from the textbook by L. V. Fausett, Numerical Methods: Algorithms and Applications, ISBN 0-13-031400-5, 2003. The implementation is based off the psuedocode in the text, however, one could be more exact by using the reference C, Matlab, or Matcad code. As of now, no effort has been made to optimize the alogrithms for Julia. Feel free to contribute and improve.
